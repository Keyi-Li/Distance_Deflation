# Distance Deflation
## Overview
This repository implements the algorithm presented in **[Euclidean Distance Deflation under High-Dimensional Heteroskedastic Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18520)**

The algorithm is designed to estimate noise magnitudes and correct pairwise distances in high-dimensional datasets corrupted by heteroskedastic noise. 

Method Highlights: 
- Hyperparameter-free
- Requires no prior knowledge of the clean data structure or noise distribution
- No restrictive assumptions
