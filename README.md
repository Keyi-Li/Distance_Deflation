# Distance Deflation
This repository implements the algorithm from: **[Euclidean Distance Deflation under High-Dimensional Heteroskedastic Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18520)**

The algorithm is designed to estimate noise magnitudes and correct pairwise distances in high-dimensional datasets corrupted by heteroskedastic noise. 
- hyperparameter-free
- require no prior knowledge of the clean data structure or noise distribution
- no restrictive assumption

The workflow is as follow: <p align="center">
